metOcean-mapping
================

metOcean mapping is a knowledge base providing information on translating meteorological and oceanographic metadata.

This project provides software to manage the knowledge base and the knowledge base content. The knowledge is stored as RDF Turtle datasets in StaticData.

To contribute to the project, the static data should be used to populate a local triple store which the management software may access.
