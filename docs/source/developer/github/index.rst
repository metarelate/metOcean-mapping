Github Information Management
*****************************

The MetaRelate project uses github to manage and maintain the translation information.

Translation information is stored as rdf turtle in ascii files in a github repository. 

This can be retrieved and parsed for use in applications.

Updating Translations
=====================

To provide updates, the information and the management application should be used together to make a set of additive changes to the rdf turtle.  This change can then be proposed, as a pull request, to the main github repository.

A member of the metarelate mangement team will evaulate the pull request and work with the pull requester to merge the proposed changes into the repository.
